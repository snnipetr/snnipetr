## Hi!!
### Welcome to my Github Profile!
Hello visitor, I am Debraj Maji, a 4th year Undergrad student at the department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. 
My main interests lie in Machine learning/Deep learning as you will find while going through my profile.

In my free time I can be found :
- dabbling in a bit of leetcode/dsa once in a while to keep my mind agile.
- I love tech in general and in my free time try to keep myself updated on any piece of new tech that launches.
- playing games, and many other things.

Hope you like the projects that I have done. Most of these are either course projects, or my personal projects that I do in my free time to increase my knowledge in certain technologies.
