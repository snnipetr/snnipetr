##Hi!! Welcome to my Github Profile!
Hello visitor, I am Debraj Maji, a 4th year Undergrad student at the department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. My main interests lie in Machine learning/Deep learning as you will find while going through my profile.
Hope you like the projects that I have done. Most of these are either course projects, or my personal projects that I do in my free time to explore my passion regarding Machine learning.
